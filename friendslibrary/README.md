Friend's Library

An app that creates a library of books, movies, and games that a group of friends are willing to share between each other.

You create a user. The user enters a list of books, movies, games, tools, or anything they are willing to share. This creates a bookshelf. It lists who owns it and where it is.

The user can invite friends. As friends share their bookshelf, then the user gets a unified shelf that they can browse or search.

If an user borrows an item, then the item will show its current location.

If people get defriended, those items disappear from the bookshelf.

People can formally introduce others to become friends.

People can leave comments about the item and say thanks to the other people.
